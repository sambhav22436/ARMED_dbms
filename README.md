-- This was a fictional project for my university dbms course. I am not an illegal arms trader. (atleast not yet)

Scope

The Authorities have had exclusive access to military grade weapons ever since we evolved
from swords and shields to precision missiles and drones. But the authorities are often
tyrannical. The civilians cannot put up a strong resistance if it's only the government which has
high tech weapons.This exclusive access has led to countless genocides throughout history and
they will keep happening unless we do something about it. We need to balance the equation.
ARMED inc is a B2C platform committed to providing civilians with access to top-tier military
equipment while maintaining the highest standards of safety and security.Our mission is to
empower the common citizen with the tools they need to safeguard their homes,properties and
loved ones.

The project had every feature an online weapons store should except the inventory to sell.
